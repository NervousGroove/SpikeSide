# üöÄ SpikeSide
SpikeSide is a library developed for the SpellSpike language, and dedicated to developing games on Unreal Engine. With SpikeSide you can develop games in Unreal Engine, using the SpellSpike language, which is much easier and faster than C++ and Blueprint.

# üìñ License
SpikeSide is under the restrictive CC-NC-ND 4.0 license, meaning you can't change/modify SpikeSide's source code, but you can distribute your game freely, as long as you don't modify SpikeSide's source code.

# üì¶ How to Install
To install SpikeSide is extremely easy. Just go to "https://shre.ink/spikeside", wait to download the .ZIP file and when downloaded, extract it into a folder of your choice and delete all extracted files except the "spikeside.cpp" and "spikeconfig.spike" files. After making the deletions you must edit the file "spikeconfig.spike". In this file (spikeconfig.spike) you must add the names of the SpellSpike (.spike) files you will be using (if you don't have them already, create them and add their names to the "spikeconfig.spike" file), for example, suppose you have two files, and their names are "test. spike" and "func.spike", then in the file "spikeconfig.spike" you should write "test.spike, func.spike" (always separating the filenames with commas, if there is only one, discard the need for commas). After that, everything is ready! You can now start programming.

# ü•§ Easier, faster and wider
The SpellSpike language is high-level and is more modern than the C++ language and even the Blueprint visual language. It is perfect for everything, including game developments.

# üêä Supported by VSCODE
SpellSpike is compatible with many IDEs. But it does not have debugging, formatting, and auto-completion in all IDEs. For a more comfortable experience with a more intense workflow, you should use Visual Studio Code, because it offers debugging, formatting, and auto-completion for the SpellSpike language, thanks to the official extension.
